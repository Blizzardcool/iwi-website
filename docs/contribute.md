# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for taking the time. On this page you find some general hints on how we
"want to do things" around here, both for social interaction as well as
technical details (see below).

## Be nice!

We're students here, and some of us are beginners. Being nice and answering
questions are an easy way to make everyone feel welcome and thus increasing the
chances of motivated contributions to our website.

## Why English?

We know, we're mostly non-native English speakers. Nonetheless, it's a public
code repository and we want to include everyone. We feel like English is the
best language to achieve this. You might want to consider it practice for
yourself. Also: English is only mandatory in code, comments and docs. If you're
working on content, this rule obviously doesn't apply. (However English versions
of e. g. news posts are of course highly appreciated!)

## Contributing Content, Design or Something Else

### For the First Time

If you're a first-time contributor, it's easiest to fork the repository, create
a branch and then open a pull request in our main repository. if you don't know
how this works, check out the following resources:

* [Git Basics and Cheat Sheet](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [How To Create A PR (in German)](https://www.atlassian.com/de/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request)
* [Creating your first PR at firstcontributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

If you've never worked with git before, we recommend practicing with own
repositories for some time.

### Contributing Regularly

As an active member of the student body in general and as part of the working
group *website* in particular, you can become a member of the organization.
That means you can create your branches on the original repository instead of
working in your fork all the time. Please ask for access in the Slack channel
**#ak_website**.

### I Want to Contribute, But I Don't Know What

There are probably some open issues that need attention. Pick something that's
interesting to you and leave a comment on the issue so we know you're working on
it.

## Git Commit Messages

Please adhere to the following rules for your commit messages:

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* If you're working on a certain area that is not website content, consider
  adding brackets with an area for quick identification like so:
  * `[Design] Change color palette in footer component`
  * `[Fix] Fix missing className param on static pages`
  * `[CI/CD] Update deployment container image`

[See this blog post for background information](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

## And now?

That's the basics, you're all set. Pick a specific area and get to work!
