# Evaluation

After deciding on four SSGs at the end of the previous [research](./research.md)
step, it is necessary to further evaluate those frameworks. The process is
straightforward: First, we define a list of criteria, mostly containing features
that we would like the new site to have. After that, we compare everyone of our
candidates against this list. The resulting matrix should tell us which
framework is suited best for being the backbone of the new website.

## Criteria

* **Quality of Documentation**: How well is the documentation written? Is it
  up-to-date? Are there beginner tutorials? This includes the developer
  community to some extent.
* **Initial Setup Speed**: How fast is it possible to get a working site? This
  excludes using a pre-made template, as we want to implement the design from
  scratch. Which brings us to...
* **Possibilities/Complexity of the Template Engine**: Every SSG relies on some
  sort of templating language to render sites. How easy is it to understand it?
  Allows it for complex setups, while it is still easy to read and write at the
  same time?
* **Build Speed**: Should not weigh in that much at the end, as the site will be
  quite small in terms of content. Nevertheless, a few seconds of re-rendering
  can make a big difference in terms of developer happiness.
* **Integration of Third-Party Contents**: Some wished-for features of the
  website include the integration of social media feeds or other third-party
  content. How complicated is it to integrate such data?
* **Homepage feature**: Most SSGs support a distinction between blog posts and
  static sites (think of legal pages like data protection statements). However,
  there are differences in the functionality and ease of creating a homepage
  that combines both a news feed and static contents. How well is that handled?
* **Blog Awareness/Possibilities**: Blog awareness is basically a must-have for
  SSGs. However, the possibilities of ordering, categorizing, tagging, drafting
  and publishing blog posts can differ from framework to framework.
